Flashing your G-tab P709M can help you to solve various problems such as bootloop, hang on logo, virus infection, slow performance, etc. However, sometimes flashing can also cause the lcd screen to display wrong colors or become blank.

Before you proceed, make sure you have a backup of your important data and a fully charged battery. Also, you need a computer, a USB cable, and a flash tool such as SP Flash Tool or Miracle Box. Follow the steps below carefully and do not skip any step.
